Select and share a place app
===============================================
Now in the last module we learned how to work with third party libraries in typescript and that's exactly what we'll build up on this module.

We will build a tiny application a very simple Web site where we will use third party libraries to send HTTP requests and also to render a map.

With the help of google maps. So that is what we'll do. And of course we'll do all of this with typescript.
